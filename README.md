# Geovoronoi-Chalice-API
API built in Chalice that returns given coordinates voronoi regions



## Voronoi principle

This API follows the mathematical principle called Voronoi Diagrams. It divides the zone based on the distance between each set of points and maximizes the region given that distance.
